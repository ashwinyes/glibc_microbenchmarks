Compiling the microbenchmarks
-----------------------------
Edit the scripts/compile.sh to reflect the paths to the new and old glibc
installations.

For compiling the sinf microbenchmark run from the top directory,
./scripts/compile.sh sinf/sinf_benchmark.c

For compiling the cosf microbenchmark run from the top directory,
./scripts/compile.sh cosf/cosf_benchmark.c

This will create the benchmark binaries new.out and old.out in bin directory.
Running these binaries will give the average cycles count (over 1000 calls to
sinf/cosf) for different input values of sinf/cosf.

Notes
-----
The benchmark code uses the PMU cycle counter to calculate the cpu cycles. You
need to enable access to this counter from userspace. Otherwise the benchmark
will signal an Illegal Instruction.

Follow section "38.2.2. High-resolution cycle counter" in the DPDK guide at
http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/prog_guide/profile_app.html to enable the access to
PMU cycle counter from userspace.
